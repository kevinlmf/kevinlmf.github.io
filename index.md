## 🎓 About Me

I'm currently pursuing a Master’s in **Applied Statistics** at the **University of Michigan, Ann Arbor**.  
My academic and project experience focus on:

- 📈 High-dimensional statistics & copula-based dependence modeling  
- 🤖 Reinforcement learning & algorithmic trading strategies  
- 📊 Statistical inference, deep learning, and financial applications  

I'm passionate about combining statistical rigor with modern AI methods to build robust, interpretable, and scalable solutions.
