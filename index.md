# 👋 Hi, I'm Mengfan Long

I'm a graduate student in **Applied Statistics** at the **University of Michigan, Ann Arbor**, interested in:

- High-dimensional statistics  
- Reinforcement learning & algorithmic trading  
- Copula-based dependence modeling and financial applications

---

## 🧠 Academic Background

- 🎓 Master of Applied Statistics, University of Michigan (2024–2026)
- 🎓 B.Econ (Honours), University of Queensland (First Class Honours)

---

## 🛠️ Projects & Research

- **High-Dimensional Copula Model (RA Project)**  
  Developed sparse EM for Gaussian mixtures, extended to hierarchical copula mixtures (HD-GMCM) to model nonlinear tail dependencies.

- **Automated Trading System**  
  Built a real-time trading system with PPO/DDPG RL agents using PyTorch + C++ bindings. Supports backtesting, reward shaping, and low-latency simulation.
